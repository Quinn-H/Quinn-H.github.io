  <h5>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h5>
    <p>

      The learning experience in DBC/EDA is very different to the traditional school.
      DBC/EDA not only focus on student’s technique skills, but also teaching them soft
      skills. This is my first week in EDA,
      I can feel I am in a supportive learning community with people who have same goals.
      I feel more confident to explore new world when I studying and working in a team.
