  <h4>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
    <p>
      I havenâ€™t try anything yet, but I am very interesting in Pomodoro Technique and timeboxing.c
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>what did you find interesting?</h4>
    <p>
      All of them are interesting, but I will try Promodoro technique,
      timeboxing and tiny habit first.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>what worked for you?</h4>
    <p>
      Timeboxing worked for me.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>which will you experiment further with?</h4>
    <p>
      I will start with tiny habit, but I need to do more research on it.
      I think it will change my whole life to a new era.
